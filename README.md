# VBA_personal

Inititally the idea was to have a repository, for the personal.xlsb.
Then it grew bigger. Now it is pretty much anything good that I write, that could be reused, so I do not have to reinvent the wheel every day. 
One day (probably never), when I have time I would group them in a better way. 
Until then, I would use the search option.
