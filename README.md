# VBA_personal

Inititally the idea was to have a repository, for the personal.xlsb.
Then it grew bigger. Then I read an article about Hungarian Notation and I have decided to use it. Then I read [what Joel thought about it and it](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/) and I have decided to abandon it completely. 
Now it is pretty much anything good that I write, that could be reused, so I do not have to reinvent the wheel every day. If I have to reuse it, I sometimes change the naming convention, avoiding the bad Hungarian notation. One day (probably never), when I have time I would group them in a better way.  Until then, I would use the search option.
    
Good luck, have fun from [VitoshAcademy](http://www.vitoshacademy.com)

Feel free to make pull requests, I would take a look at anyone of them.
